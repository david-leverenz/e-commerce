# e-Commerce Back-end
This is a back end for an e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies.

## Description
This is a functional Express.js API.<br>
When you add your database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file you are able to connect to a database using Sequelize.<br>
When you enter schema and seed commands then a development database is created and is seeded with test data.<br>
When you enter the command to invoke the application the server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database.<br>
When you open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON.<br>
When you test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core you are able to successfully create, update, and delete data in your database.<br>
